# What Is Dropleaf Games
Dropleaf games is a collection of my tabletop game designs and the methods I use to create them. A dropleaf table folds out into a larger playing surface. A Dropleaf Game aspires to be **extensible** or **modular**. Also Imagine a floating leaf and a dropped anvil, likewise a  Dropleaf game aspires to be light on **rules complexity** and heavy on **emergent complexity**. 

# My Designs
